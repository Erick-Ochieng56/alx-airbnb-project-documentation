# User Stories Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains user stories derived from the use case diagram for the Airbnb Clone project. These user stories translate the technical functionalities into requirements from the perspective of different user types.

## Purpose
User stories help in:
- Understanding user needs and expectations
- Defining acceptance criteria for features
- Prioritizing development tasks
- Ensuring user-centered design approach

## Structure
The user stories are organized by major feature categories:
- User Management
- Property Management
- Booking System
- Payment System
- Review System
- Communication System

Each user story follows the standard format:
```
As a [user type],
I want to [action],
So that [benefit/value].
```

Each story includes acceptance criteria that define when the implementation is considered complete and successful.

## Files
- **user-stories.md**: Contains all user stories with their acceptance criteria

## How to Use
These user stories should be used as a reference for:
- Feature development planning
- Creating test scenarios
- Verifying implementation meets user needs
- Tracking progress on requirement implementation

## Relationship to Other Documentation
These user stories are directly derived from the use cases identified in the use case diagram. They provide more detailed requirements for each interaction represented in that diagram.
